libdnstd
========

General Library Built as a Learning Experience in C++

This is a c++ library that I have created over the years for various applications I have made. The classes in the library generally have served two purposes. Some, such as Double and Complex, act as wrappers to extend data types to suit my needs. Others, like DString, were more of an academic exercise and therefore should not be used most of the time as better standard library classes exist. The name, libdnstd, is an homage to the GNU Project. "dnstd" is a recursive acronym that stands for "dnstd's not std", where std refers to the standard library. libdnstd is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 3 (see COPYING). If (for some reason...) you use this library, I would be interested in hearing how and why. Please email me at david@davecoss.com
